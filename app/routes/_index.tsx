					I'm Shane Walker, a passionate and self-taught software engineer with
					a rich experience spanning over five years in the tech industry. My
					journey has led me to master JavaScript & TypeScript. I've also had
					the pleasure of working with Go, Rust & Python at length. I pride
					myself on my proficiency in DevOps and deployment processes, with a
					particular focus on Docker, which I've leveraged in environments
					handling the demands of millions of users across diverse sectors.

					My career has been a blend of empowering small businesses to transcend
					their limits and being an integral part of a team that successfully
					executed large-scale projects, each a 10,000-yard march in its own
					right. At the core of my professional ethos is a commitment to solving
					complex business challenges, particularly in navigating and optimizing
					across different cloud providers. My goal is always to harness
					technology to forge new paths and possibilities, whether for a
					burgeoning startup or a well-established enterprise.
