					<p>
						I'm Shane Walker, a passionate and self-taught software engineer
						with a rich experience spanning over five years in the tech
						industry. My journey has led me to master JavaScript & TypeScript.
						I've also had the pleasure of working with Go, Rust, Kotlin & Python
						at length. I pride myself on my proficiency in DevOps and deployment
						processes, with a particular focus on Docker, which I've leveraged
						in environments handling the demands of millions of users across
						diverse sectors.
					</p>

					<p>
						My career has been a blend of empowering small businesses to
						transcend their limits and being an integral part of a team that
						successfully executed large-scale projects, each a 10,000-yard march
						in its own right. At the core of my professional ethos is a
						commitment to solving complex business challenges, particularly in
						navigating and optimizing across different cloud providers. My goal
						is always to harness technology to forge new paths and
						possibilities, whether for a burgeoning startup or a
						well-established enterprise.
