# {frontmatter.title}

At Lemongrass Cloud I provided technical leadership and guidance to a team of 5 developers. I was responsible for the design and implementation of a number of key features for the Lemongrass Cloud Platform. I also worked closely with the product team to help define the product roadmap and to provide estimates for new features.
